# Turtle-crossing-game
A fun and engaging game inspired by the classic "Frogger." Help the turtle cross the road while avoiding speeding cars. Each successful crossing increases the difficulty as more cars zoom by!

## Features
1. Player-Controlled Turtle:
- Use the Up arrow key to move the turtle forward.
2. Randomized Car Obstacles:
- Cars of random colors and positions appear, making every game unique.
3. Dynamic Difficulty:
- Each level increases car speed, adding an extra challenge.
4. Scoreboard:
- Tracks your progress and displays the current level.
5. Collision Detection:
- If the turtle collides with a car, the game ends with a "GAME OVER" message.

## Code Structure
- main.py: Manages game flow and logic.
- player.py: Handles the turtle player's movement and crossing logic.
- car_manager.py: Generates and manages car obstacles with increasing difficulty.
- scoreboard.py: Displays the current level and handles the game over message.
